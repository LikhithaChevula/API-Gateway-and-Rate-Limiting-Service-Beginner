API Gateway = main entry 
/hello = a specific entry point 
Hello from Service = message inside that entry point

# When You Run the Program

Command:
python gateway.py

Output in Terminal:
API Gateway running at http://localhost:8080
(Here my local Host is 8080)

This comes from:
print("API Gateway running at http://localhost:8080")

It means:
>>>The server started successfully
>>>It is listening for requests
>>>It is waiting (nothing else will print yet)

# When You Open the Browser (First Request)

URL you type:
http://localhost:8080/hello

What the Browser Displays:
Hello from Service

# Step-by-Step Output Flow

Step 1: Browser sends request
The browser sends a GET request to:
/hello

Step 2: Server receives request
The Python server:
Accepts the request
Automatically calls:
do_GET()

Step 3: Path is checked
self.path == "/hello"
This is true

Step 4: Success response is prepared
self.send_response(200)
This tells the browser:
“Request successful”

Step 5: Headers are closed
self.end_headers()
Now the server can send data.

Step 6: Message is sent
self.wfile.write(b"Hello from Service")
This sends the actual output.

Step 7: Browser shows output
The browser receives the message and displays:
Hello from Service

# What Happens After Multiple Requests

If you refresh or request too fast:
Browser Output:
Too Many Requests

>>>Why this output appears
The rate limiter checks:
if not rate_limiter.allow_request(user_ip):

If request count > limit:

self.send_response(429)
429 means:
“Slow down, you sent too many requests”

# What If You Visit / Instead?
URL:
http://localhost:8080/

Output:
Welcome to API Gateway

# Why?
Because of:
if self.path == "/":

# What If You Visit an Unknown Path?
URL:
http://localhost:8080/likhitha

Output:
404
(or blank page depending on browser)

# Why?
Because no path matched:
else:
    self.send_response(404)

# The output depends on which URL path you request and whether the rate limit allows it.
